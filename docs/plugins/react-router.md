# React Router

[React Router V4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [Redux integration](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-redux). 

Internally, uses [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom) for browser based apps and [react-router-native](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-native) for react native apps. Moreover, re-exports both packages on their respective platforms.

## Usage

Run the following command in the plugin directoy:

```shell
npm i --save @blueeast/bluerain-plugin-react-router
```

Then in your boot function, pass the plugin like this:

```javascript
import BR from '@blueeast/bluerain-os';
import ReactRouterPlugin from '@blueeast/bluerain-plugin-react-router';

BR.boot({
	plugins: [ReactRouterPlugin]
})
```

## Components

This plugin registers following components in the Component registry, so they can be reused later by other apps and plugins:
