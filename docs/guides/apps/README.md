# Apps

Apps are one of the major building blocks of BlueRain. Each app adds it's own pages/routes to the system and can have any number of pages.

An app in the BlueRain eco-system is just a React Component. 

BlueRain Apps can also be used to break different functionalities of your project into multiple isolate modules.
